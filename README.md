# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
I used Bootstrap and react js and many other libraries. I didn't use redux because it's a small application, so I transferred values ​​via properties.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
git clone https://github.com/benedettix/Nasa-photos-website
Then ### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
